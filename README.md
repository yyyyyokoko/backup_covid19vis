The pandemic of COVID-19 has become one of the major challenges of global public health. To help the public and decision-makers better understand the trend and the influence of COVID-19, this project not only creates visualizations to demonstrate the underlying patterns of COVID-19 and its impacts, but also added interactive features which allow users to focus on many of the relevant aspects and obtain interesting findings through the rich information. The website contains six tabs, representing COVID-19â€™s overview and its impacts on Lockdown, Mobility, Public Opinion, Unemployment, and Legislation to answer if the curve has been flattened through various perspectives such as social media, mobility, unemployment, etc. 

Our project is built on Python Plotly and Dash, then the website is deployed via Heroku. 
To run the code, clone the repository and type `python3 app.py` in your terminal.
